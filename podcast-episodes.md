For the 2018-2019 calendar year, I worked with 6 other friends to create a "news" podcast that would release daily. 
Each person was delegated to a fixed day of the week, and would research/write/record their content independently as 
to meet our throughput goal.

I've distilled the episodes I made into a more accesible list for easier accesiblity. 

Most of these couldn't even charitably be considered "news".
